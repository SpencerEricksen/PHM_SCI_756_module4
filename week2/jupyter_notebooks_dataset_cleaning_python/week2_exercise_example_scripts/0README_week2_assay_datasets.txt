The assay was screened against the MLSMR in a quantitative 
high-throughput screen (qHTS, (Inglese et al., 2006)) of six 
library concentrations where ThT (AID 1460), FP mP (AID 1468)
 and FP total fluorescence (AID 1463) readouts were collected. 
The total fluorescence measurement for the FP assay served as 
a counterscreen to identify fluorescent compounds. The 
titration-response data were curve-fit and classified to 
identify actives and nascent SAR analysis was performed.
